## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file.

`JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`, `MONGO_URI`, `API_KEY`

#### JWT Secret

To generate tokens in auth service you need to provide env variable
`JWT_SECRET`. It should be a string value. You should use the same secret in
the API you're building to verify the JWT tokens.

#### PORT

Default `PORT` for Movie Service is 4000.

#### MONGO_URI

The URI that lets you connect to a MongoDB service either in your local machine.

#### API_KEY

`OMDb API The Open Movie Database` is a free API service where you can search for
movie information. To be able to pull data from their database, you need an
API Key that authorized you to get a movie data in their platform.
You can create your own API Key [here](https://omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).

## Running Tests

```bash
  npm run test
```

## Things i would have done differently if it were prod

- Put the env in secret rather then exposing them in the main.yml file
- covered more test
- uses a dynamic token in the test
